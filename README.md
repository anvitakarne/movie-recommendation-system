# 🎬 Graph-Based Movie Recommendation System  

## 📌 Overview  
This project explores **graph-based techniques** for building a **Movie Recommendation System** using **network analysis and topic modeling**.  
By leveraging **complex social media data**, we analyze relationships between users, movies, and preferences to provide **personalized movie recommendations**.  

---

## 🔍 **Why Use Graph Data & Network Analysis?**  
Unlike traditional recommendation systems, this project **models user-movie interactions as a graph**, where:  
- **Nodes** represent users, movies, and genres.  
- **Edges** represent interactions such as ratings, reviews, and social media activity.  
- **Community Detection Algorithms** identify clusters of similar users with shared interests.  

By applying **graph algorithms & network analysis**, we can:  
✅ Discover hidden relationships between users and movies.  
✅ Identify communities with similar viewing preferences.  
✅ Improve recommendation accuracy using topic modeling & graph-based similarity.  

---

## ⚙️ **Core Techniques Used**
- **Network Graphs**: Constructing a **user-movie interaction graph** using `NetworkX`.  
- **Community Detection**: Identifying clusters using **Louvain Algorithm** (`community_louvain`).  
- **Topic Modeling**: Using **Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)** from `Gensim` to analyze user reviews & extract topics.  
- **Graph Layouts & Visualization**: Applying **Graphviz & Matplotlib** for interactive visualizations.  

---

## 🛠️ **Technologies & Libraries Used**
- **pandas, numpy** - Data preprocessing & numerical operations  
- **networkx** - Graph-based user-movie interactions  
- **community-louvain** - Community detection for recommendation  
- **matplotlib, graphviz** - Graph visualization  
- **gensim** - NLP & topic modeling for extracting movie preferences  

---

## 🎯 **Key Findings**
- **Graph-Based Recommendations** outperform traditional models in discovering niche movies.  
- **Community Detection** identifies strong user clusters with similar tastes.  
- **Topic Modeling on Reviews** provides additional filtering based on sentiment & themes.  

---

## ✍ Conclusion  

Graph-based recommendation systems offer a **more natural way** to model **real-world relationships** between users, movies, and social interactions.  
By **combining network analysis & topic modeling**, we create a **more personalized and insightful** recommendation engine.  

📌 **Key Takeaways:**  
✅ **Network Analysis** improves recommendation accuracy by identifying user communities.  
✅ **Topic Modeling** enhances filtering based on movie themes & user preferences.  
✅ **Graph-based methods** capture complex social interactions that traditional models miss.  

🚀 **This approach brings us closer to truly intelligent movie recommendations!**
